        <p>The name "Nepal" is first recorded in texts from the Vedic period of the Indian subcontinent, 
            the era in ancient Nepal when Hinduism was founded, the predominant religion of the country.
             In the middle of the first millennium BC, Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, was born in Lumbini in southern Nepal. 
            Parts of northern Nepal were intertwined with the culture of Tibet.</p>

            <h1>Nepal and Its Beauty</h1>
           <div> <img src="./images/Farmer.jpg"/></div>
            
            <p>PHYSICAL OVERVIEW: Nepal, country of Asia, lying along the southern slopes of the Himalayan mountain ranges.
                 It is a landlocked country located between India to the east, south, and west and the Tibet
                  Autonomous Region of China to the north. Its territory extends roughly 500 miles (800 kilometres) 
                  from east to west and 90 to 150 miles from north to south. The capital city is Kathmandu.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="item">
            <p>POLITICAL OVERVIEW:Nepal, long under the rule of hereditary prime ministers favouring a policy of isolation,
                 remained closed to the outside world until a palace revolt in 1950 restored the 
                 crown’s authority in 1951; the country gained admission to the United Nations in 1955. 
                In 1991 the kingdom established a multiparty parliamentary system.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="item">
            <p>TOPOGRAPHY: Nepal contains some of the most rugged and difficult mountain terrain in the world. 
                Roughly 75 percent of the country is covered by mountains. From the south to the north,
                 Nepal can be divided into four main physical belts, each of which extends east to west
                  across the country. These are, first, the Tarai, a low, flat, fertile land adjacent to 
                  the border of India; second, the forested Churia foothills and the Inner Tarai zone, rising from
                   the Tarai plain to the rugged Mahābhārat Range; third, the mid-mountain region between the
                    Mahābhārat Range and the Great Himalayas; and, fourth, the Great Himalaya Range, rising to more 
                    than 29,000 feet (some 8,850 metres).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="item">
            <p>RIVERS:The rivers have considerable potential for development of hydroelectric power. 
                Two irrigation-hydroelectric projects have been undertaken jointly with India on 
                the Kosi and Nārāyani rivers. Discussions have been held to develop the enormous
                 potential of the Karnāli River. A 60,000-kilowatt hydroelectric project at Kulekhani,
                  funded by the World Bank, Kuwait, and Japan, began operation in 1982.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="item">
            <p>CLIMATE:Nepal’s climate, influenced by elevation as well as by its location in a subtropical latitude,
                 ranges from subtropical monsoon conditions in the Tarai, through a warm temperate climate 
                 between 4,000 and 7,000 feet in the mid-mountain region, to cool temperate conditions in the higher
                  parts of mountains between 7,000 and 11,000 feet, to an Alpine climate at altitudes between 14,000 and 16,000 feet 
                  along the lower slopes of the Himalaya mountains. At altitudes above 16,000 feet the temperature is always 
                  below freezing and the surface covered by snow and ice.</p>

            <p>Machapuchare, Machhapuchchhre or Machhapuchhre, is a mountain situated in the Annapurna
                 massif of Gandaki Province, north-central Nepal. Its highest peak has never been officially
                 climbed due to the impossibility of gaining a permit from the government of Nepal.</p>

        <div class="main">
            <p>The forested areas of the Tarai are the home of tigers and leopards, gaurs (wild ox), 
                occasional elephants and buffalo, and many deer; the deer include chital, or axis, deer
                 (which have white-spotted bodies), sambar (a large Asiatic deer with coarse hair on the 
                 throat and strong antlers), and swamp deer. The Lesser Rāpti Valley, in south-central
                  Nepal, is one of the last homes of the great Indian rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis). </p>
              <p>Mahābhārat Range, at elevations between 5,000 and 10,000 feet, vegetation consists of a mixture of many species,
                 chiefly pines, oaks, rhododendrons, poplars, walnuts, and larch. Between 10,000 and 12,000 feet,
                  fir mixed with birch, as well as rhododendron, abound. In the mid-mountain region of Nepal a fairly 
                  dense population has cleared all but the most inaccessible parts of the forest, which are restricted
                   to areas of steep slopes and rocky terrain.</p>

         <div class="sidebar">
           <h1>GOVERMENT AND SOCIETY</h1>
           <p>COSTITUTIONAL  FRAMEWORK:  </p>
        <p> Prior to 1990 the country was divided for administrative purposes into 5 development regions,
             14 zones, and 75 districts; in addition there were corresponding regional, zonal, and district 
             courts, as well as a Supreme Court. The 1990 constitution mandated the elimination of the regional 
             and zonal courts, which were to be replaced by appellate courts. The administrative divisions themselves 
             continued to exist as provisional units. </p>

         <p> The early 21st century was a tumultuous yet transformative period in Nepal’s governmental history.
             A Maoist insurgency that had been gaining strength since the late 1990s demanded not only 
             the election of a constituent assembly to draft a new constitution but also the abolition of the monarchy. </p>

         <p>  As the insurgents negotiated with the government, tensions escalated into violence. Following intermittent
             peace talks, abortive cease-fires, dissolution and reconstitution of the House of Representatives,
              and major abrogation of the king’s authority, the Maoists and the government finally agreed to 
              the drafting of an interim constitution—promulgated in January 2007—and the formation of an interim
               administration. Elections for a constituent assembly of some 600 members were held in April 2008,
                and the following month the monarchy was indeed dissolved and Nepal declared a republic. </p>

         <p> The country continued to operate for several more years under an interim constitution that provided 
            for a unicameral legislature and a Council of Ministers, with most of the power vested in the
            prime minister. Protracted negotiations finally produced a new permanent constitution in 2015, 
            which was approved by the legislature and promulgated on September 20. The document established
             a secular federal-style republic consisting of seven administrative regions and a bicameral legislature.
              A president would be head of state, and the Council of Ministers, led by the prime minister,
               would continue as head of government.</p>

                  parts of Sarangkot and Kaskikot. The lake is stream-fed but a dam regulates the water reserves, therefore,
                   the lake is classified as semi-natural freshwater lake.[1]
